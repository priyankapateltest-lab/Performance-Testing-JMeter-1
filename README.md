## 👩‍💻 About This Repository

Hi, I’m **Priyanka Patel**, **Software Test Engineer** passionate about automation and performance testing.  
This repository is where I document everything I’m learning about **Performance & Load Testing** using **Apache JMeter**.  

I’m exploring how to simulate heavy user loads, analyze application performance, and integrate JMeter with other QA tools to build a complete performance testing workflow. 💪  

---

## 📘 What I’m Learning

Here’s what I’m focusing on step-by-step 👇  

✅ **Understanding Load Testing Concepts**  
Learning how to apply load on **web applications** and **REST APIs** to analyze their performance.

✅ **Complete Knowledge of JMeter Features**  
Exploring all the core components of JMeter:
- Thread Groups  
- Samplers  
- Config Elements  
- Listeners  
- Assertions  
- Timers  

✅ **Writing Load Test Cases**  
Creating detailed **test plans** to measure system behavior under different loads and stress levels.

✅ **Application Performance Monitoring**  
Learning to track **response times**, **throughput**, **error percentage**, and **server resource usage** during tests.

✅ **JMeter Plugins for Advanced Reporting**  
Using JMeter add-in plugins like:
- 🧮 **Custom Graphs**  
- 📊 **Aggregate Reports**  
- 📈 **Dynamic HTML Dashboards**  

✅ **Integration with Selenium**  
Understanding how to integrate **Selenium test scripts with JMeter** to measure frontend performance along with backend load.

✅ **Beanshell Scripting Basics**  
Learning **Beanshell scripting** to extend JMeter’s capabilities — custom logic, parameterization, and dynamic data handling.
